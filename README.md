# Reaction Diffusion Simulation

This is a simple implementation of the reaction diffusion simulation. It is a pretty simulation that gets great results with simple math formulas.

This implementation is following the Coding Train tutorial: [Coding Challenge #13: Reaction Diffusion Algorithm in p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9ny785UNc&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH&index=17&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain)

Which is also following this guy's tutorial: [Karl Sims' Reaction-Diffusion Tutorial](http://karlsims.com/rd.html)
